# Amsteel Blue Soft Shackles

I just love these little buggers. 

They have to be one of the coolest pieces of gear I've come across yet.

So incredibly light, but also strong.

A little cord that can hold so much. Those little fibers getting all snug with one another.

Thousands of pounds held for a few grams of weight. Soft and packable. No-triloading! Crazy
